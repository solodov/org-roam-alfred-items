* DONE Chrome items

Python implementation parses the file and extracts sections. However roam maintains all this
data in its database.

The biggest annoyance of the python implementation is speed. It's slow enough that when I
press enter it still processes input. This causes chrome searches to have characters cut
off.

Removing the need to parse and relying entirely on the roam database allows for an easy go
rewrite that will be fast enough. And it also doesn't require implementing org parser in go.

This feature will require re-enabling roam for the chrome file, which will have a negative
side-effect of making these links available in find UI. There seems to be a way to deal with
this by creating a filter, see
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/p6w3dx/org_roam_can_i_filtercomplete_on_a_subset_based/.][Reddit - Dive into anything]] For
the purpose of this integration the filter will pass all nodes unless they are in chrome.org
file and level is greater than 0.

* DONE Elfeed links
CLOSED: [2023-07-11 Tue 21:41]
Elfeed links are similar to chrome links, they don't require parsing org files, roam
database is good enough.
